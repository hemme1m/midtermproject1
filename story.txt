Once upon a time in the mystical land of Shangrila there dwelt an immortal named Kai-Yun and his trusty band of ninja monkeys. Kai-Yun was very upset because he lost his sack of bananas. 

Becoming very "hangry," the ninja monkeys were determined to located the lost sack of bananas before they continued their training for the day.

The ninja monkeys searched day and night for a whole week, but were unable to locate anything other than coconuts (and ninja monkeys, as everyone knows, hate coconuts).

This made Kai-Yun extremely upset because he needed those bananas to continue a life of immortality.
