Once upon a time in the mystical land of Shangrila there dwelt an immortal named Kai-Yun and his trusty band of students. Kai-Yun was very upset because he lost his sack of bananas.

Becoming very "hangry," the students were determined to located the lost sack of bananas before they continued their training for the day.

The students searched day and night for a whole week, but were unable to locate anything other than coconuts (and students, as everyone knows, hate coconuts).

This made Kai-Yun extremely upset because he needed those bananas to continue a life of immortality.

While Kai-Yun was in fear of an uprising by the students, some African swallows, not to be confused with European swallows, swooped down to pick up the discarded coconut shells and carried them off to Camelot.

Kai-Yun had heard whispers of Camelot's abundance of banana traders, but words escaped him as he marveled at Camelot's beautifully bountiful banana bazaar.
