<!--

PROJECT TO-DO LIST:

* Page Setup
Header (spans entire page)
Landing Div (spans entire page until user clicks box, then takes up half page alongside form that appears)
Stage Div (div that contains an image of a sample theater stage)
Seat Box Div (div that contains 4 rows of 6 boxes to represent each seat)

* Box Interactivity Setup
When user clicks box, landing splits in half and form appears to enter name (text input box), payment method (drop down menu [prepay/will call]).

When user hovers over a reserved seat, the seat graphic will disappear and the user's name and payment method will show up (accessed from reservation array)

* Form Setup
Form will contain name input box and payment method drop-down menu

When user clicks submit, jQuery function will store the information in an object and push it to a reservations array. Upon submission, the box that was clicked will change background color from blue (available) to red (reserved)
